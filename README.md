# Project_Description
In this project, I create the second project given by the course, the To-do list. 
The purpose of the work is to register the data in the list by pressing the ‘add’ button when entering data into the input,
delete them at any time with the delete icon next to them, and sort the data both alphabetically 
and in reverse alphabetical order using the sort function given in the upper right part.
